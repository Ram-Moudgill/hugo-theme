## **Introduction**

How many times have you tried to process or merge documents online where you had to upload the document? I am sure that it made you wonder if your files were being saved somewhere by the tool. Was the entire procedure of merging those PDFs, safe?

Because they take advantage of operating system resources, desktop PDF editors are far more powerful. They also have a higher level of security. Finally, they are not reliant on the internet. You can edit PDFs offline if you install the software on one or more devices.

You may convert and edit PDFs on any device with online PDF editors. However, you'll need an internet connection, and the PDF editing options are limited. Security may also be a worry – read the section below for further information.

Most online media converters, mergers, and processors operate in a similar way. Users must first submit their content to the website and then wait a few seconds for the feature to work.

Most of the time, such solutions work by uploading the original media to their server. These servers may permit third-party or hackers to retrieve your information.

## **Are the online features, in general, safe to use?**

You offer the platform momentary access to the data when you upload it to an online PDF editor or converter. Depending on the type and sensitivity of the documents you work with, this could be a problem.

It's probably not a major deal if you're only working on a college assignment. But you might want to select a different option for confidential documents.

It's a question of whether the service provider is rewarded for giving you the advertised service while causing you no harm, or if the supplier is rewarded for causing you to harm and the service is really a deception to entice you. We normally say that if you don't pay with money for a service, you're paying with data.

However, using a paid online PDF editor does not ensure your privacy or security. There are also paid services where these issues can occur. It usually entails using data for audience profiling, which is a lucrative business these days.

Users of free online PDF editors, he claims, also risk downloading spyware on their devices, but this is considerably less prevalent.

Accountants, lawyers, doctors, and government personnel, for example, use desktop PDF editors to work with sensitive or confidential information.

If you have a practice that involves a lot of PDF editings, such as redactions or in-page adjustments, you should invest in a dedicated tool that can handle everything you need on your computer swiftly and securely.

## **How do you know if an online tool is safe?**

Even if you're editing PDF files that aren't relevant to your job, you should use precautions when using online PDF editors. Before you upload your PDF file to an online editing service, check out the following:

**Will they remove your file(s) once you've finished?** After two hours, some services erase files automatically. Depending on the service provider, the length of time can vary.

**Will they make any use of your information?** In such a case, how would you go about with it? Will they make it available to others? If so, what is the goal? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the use of personal data in Europe; verify if your nation has its own version of these regulations and if the website complies with them.

**What steps do they take to ensure your privacy is protected?** Do they have safeguards in place to prevent third parties from infiltrating their system and obtaining your information?

**Keynote:** While some platforms provide privacy and security information on their homepages, it's always advisable to read their terms of service and privacy policies for more information. For more information, you may need to contact the developer directly in some circumstances.
